/**
 * The OperatorDragDropService class implements the behavior of dragging an operator label from the side bar
 *  and drop it as an operator box on to the main workflow editor.
 *
 * This behavoir is implemented using jQueryUI draggable and droppable.
 *  1. jQueryUI draggable allows providing a custom DOM element that is displayed when dragging around.
 *  2. the custom DOM element (called "flyPaper") is a JointJS paper that only contains one operator box and has the exact same size of it.
 *  3. when dragging ends, the temporary DOM element ("flyPaper") is destoryed by jQueryUI
 *  4. when dragging ends (operator is dropped), it will notify the observer of the event,
 *    the Operator UI Serivce is responsible for creating an operator at the place dropped.
 *
 * The method mentioned above is the best working way to implement this functionailtiy as of 02/2018.
 * Here are some other methods that have been tried but didn't work.
 *
 *  1. Using HTML5 native drag and drop API.
 *    This doesn't work because the problem of the "ghost image" (the image that follows the mouse when dragging).
 *    The native HTML5 drag/drop API requires that the "ghost" image must be visually the same as the original element.
 *    However, in our case, the dragging operator is not the same as the original element.
 *    There is **NO** workaround for this problem: see this post for details: https://kryogenix.org/code/browser/custom-drag-image.html
 *      (part of the post isn't exactly true on Chrome anymore because the Chrome itself changed)
 *    The HTML5 drag and Drop API itself is also considered a disaster: https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2009/09/the_html5_drag.html
 *
 *  2. Using some angular drag and drop libraries for Angular, for example:
 *    ng2-dnd: https://github.com/akserg/ng2-dnd
 *    ng2-dragula: https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-dragula
 *    ng-drag-drop: https://github.com/ObaidUrRehman/ng-drag-drop
 *
 *    These drag and drop libraries have the same ghost image problem mentioned above. Moreover, some of them are designed
 *      for moving a DOM element to another place by dragging and dropping, which is not we want.
